// Arrays vs sets vs tuples

//If you need a specific, fixed collection of related values where each item has a precise position or name, you should use a tuple:
let address = (house: 555, street: "Taylor Swift Avenue", city: "Nashville")


//If you need a collection of values that must be unique or you need to be able to check whether a specific item is in there extremely quickly, you should use a set:


let set = Set(["aardvark", "astronaut", "azalea"])


//If you need a collection of values that can contain duplicates, or the order of your items matters, you should use an array:

let pythons = ["Eric", "Graham", "John", "Michael", "Terry", "Terry"]

// Complex types summary

//Arrays, sets, tuples, and dictionaries let you store a group of items under a single value. They each do this in different ways, so which you use depends on the behavior you want.
//Arrays store items in the order you add them, and you access them using numerical positions.
//Sets store items without any order, so you canâ€™t access them using numerical positions.
//Tuples are fixed in size, and you can attach names to each of their items. You can read items using numerical positions or using your names.
//Dictionaries store items according to a key, and you can read items using those keys.
//Enums are a way of grouping related values so you can use them without spelling mistakes.
//You can attach raw values to enums so they can be created from integers or strings, or you can add associated values to store additional information about each case.
